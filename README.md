## Hi, I’m Ibrahim 👋

I’m building a **cloud engineering portfolio** with a focus on **strong fundamentals**, **hands-on labs**, and **clear, reproducible documentation**—the way real teams operate in production environments.

I’m also bringing a **regulated-finance mindset** (risk, auditability, least privilege) into how I build and document cloud work.

### What you’ll find here
This repo tracks my progress across:

- **Linux & system operations** (processes, permissions, logs, troubleshooting)
- **Networking for cloud** (IP/DNS, routing, ports, connectivity debugging)
- **Cloud fundamnetals (AWS)** (IAM, VPC, EC2, S3, CloudWatch + real labs)
- **Infrastructure as Code** (**Terraform**) with repeatable environments
- **CI/CD basics** (GitHub Actions, pipelines, release discipline)
- **Python & Bash automation** for operational tasks
- **Security & reliability** (least privilege, evidence, incident basics)
- **Project-style delivery**: docs + runbooks + evidence, not just demos

---

### How I work
- **Fundamentals first → labs → documentation → iteration**
- I write notes as if someone else needs to reproduce the result:
  - what I did
  - why I did it
  - what I observed
  - what I’d change next time

---

### Structure
- Topic folders (Linux, Networking, AWS, Terraform, CI/CD, Security, etc.)
- **Projects** include:
  - `docs/` (design + decisions)
  - `runbooks/` (how to operate/debug)
  - `evidence/` (outputs/screenshots/log extracts)
  - `terraform/` (reprovisioning the environment)
